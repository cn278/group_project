    <h1>Women's Basketball Team</h1>

</div>
  <h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We're an international, enthusiastic team, always pushing for excellent results.</p>

   <p>We play in the 2A South East League and take part in the South Eastern Conference Cup.

Undoubtably, our team philosophy is to train hard, be completely focused on the court and fully committed to the team:
All our members are required to attend two training sessions each week, in addition to the games.</p>

<p>But still, we also enjoy our time together off the court and consider ourselves to be more than just another sports society!
<ul>
  <li>We organise a range of different socials, mostly weekly;</li>
  <li>We hosted charity basketball tournaments;</li>
  <li>We won a student award;</li>
  <li>We participated in tournaments abroad and met teams from all around Europe</li>
  <li>...and much more!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In short: We have become a genuine group of close friends and would love you to be part of it!
We welcome everybody who shares the same passion for basketball as we do.
Just come and show us your skills at tryouts and you might soon be part of our competitive team:)</p>

<p>If you have any queries drop us a message on our social media or send us an email. We will for sure get back to you ASAP.</p>
