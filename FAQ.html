<h3>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ</h3 >
<p>
  <ol>
    <p>
  <li> I would like to be part of your team! What do I need to do?</li>

  <div class="answer_1">
  "At the beginning of each academic year, we have tryouts where you can come along and try out for the team. Depending on our current squad and available spots, we will recruit new players. The number of new players we recruit varies from year to year and can't be fixed. If you make it on the team you will need to pay £80 for a membership to be able to play."
</div>
</p>
<p>
  <li> I love playing basketball, but I'd prefer more flexibility in my training sessions. Are there any other opportunities for me?</li>
<div class="answer_1">
  "Sure! We run weekly social sessions where you can just come along and play for an hour. There is NO need to sign up in advance. Just bring £1 and your Student ID. This scheme, known as Active US is run by SussexSport and the StudentUnion! Cf. <a href="activeus.html">Active US</a>"
  </div>
  </p>
<p>
  <li> If I am successful at the tryouts, and would like to join the team, what will I commit to?</li>
<div class="answer_1">
  "After having paid the membership fee, training can start! All our members are required to attend two training sessions each week (Tuesday 6.30pm and Friday 7 pm at the Sussex Sports Centre). We play games every week on Wednesdays, either away or at home (time depends on the location and opposition)."
</div>
  </p>
<p>
  <li> Do you organise socials?</li>
<div class="answer_1">
  "Of course we do! We're aiming to have one social each week, these can be "sober" social such as Ice Skating, Escape rooms, etc. or "going out" socials, such as Wednesday at Pryzm or Casablanca."
</div>
  </p>
  <p>
  <li> Why is the competitive selection process (tryouts) only once a year, instead of giving more students the chance to be part of the team?</li>
  <div class="answer_1">
    "As a team we train together and try to progress and develop together in order to win the league or cup. This coherent structure only works if we have a strong bond and unfortunately this can only be done by having a consistent team. For those who didn't make it on the team, there are plenty opportunites such Active US to get involved in sports."
</div>
    </p>
<p>
    <li> Do you only play against other universities, or also against non-student teams?</li>
    <div class="answer_1">
      "As a university team we play in the university league called BUCS and only compete against other universities. We also take part in the CUP which is based on knock-out rules."

      </p>
<p>
  <li> Do you play outdoors in the summer?</li>
  <div class="answer_1">
    "We don't have any planned or set dates to play outdoors. However the uni has a freshly painted basketball court near the Park Village accommodations on campus. This court is free and open to anyone who wants to shoot some hoops. When the weather is nice, some of us spend their afternoons at the beach court on the seafront."
</div>
    </p>
<p>
  <li> What are the membership fees spent on?</li>
  <div class="answer_1">

<p>
  <li> Are you engaged in any community activities?</li>
